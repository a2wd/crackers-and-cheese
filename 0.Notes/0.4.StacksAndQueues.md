# Stacks & Queues

A stack is a first-in, last-out (FILO) data structure while a queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure.

A stack is similar to a linked list except you can only *peek* at the topmost item.

A queue could also be built with a linked list, but by adding items to the tail.
