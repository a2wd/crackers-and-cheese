# Data Structures

## Arrays And Strings

### Hash tables

Map keys to values. Either at an index specified by the hash or at an index specified by `hash(key) % array_length`. The latter allows for smaller arrays.

Hash tables could be built with a BST - guarantees `O(log n)` lookup times.

### Array List

Is a dynamically resizing array. Resizing can take `O(n)` time but happens rarely.

### StringBuffer

Internally makes an array of strings, to avoid lengthy concatenation operations - speeds up by only concatenating once when `.toString()` is called.
