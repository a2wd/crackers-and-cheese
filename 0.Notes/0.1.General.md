# General notes on approaches

1. Always ask questions
2. What is the complexity, space/time?
3. How will it handle large data sets?
4. Use data structures
5. Test - edge cases, user errors, general cases.

When you find problems, think about why.

## Approaches

**Examplify** - Think of specific examples and try to derive a general rule.
**Pattern matching** - see what similar problems exist and try and modify those solutions
**Simplify & generalise** - solve a simplified version of the problem then add in the extra constraints
**Base case & build** - solve for the base case (ie, n=1) and build on that.
**Data structure brainstorm** - think through data structures to find a relevant one.

## Clean code

Try to write correct, simple, efficient, readable and maintanable code.

Don't be afraid to use data structures and reuse code. Always look for where you can make code more modular.

Code must be flexible & robust - try to write for a more general case where possible.

Don't make assumptions about input - error check.

## Good questions

* For string based questions, **is the character set in Ascii (256 chars) or Unicode (100,000 chars)
* For string based questions, it is often helpful to work backwards from the end of the string
